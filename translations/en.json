If a batch has been approved by the Finance group, it will be sent to the HyperWallet API for processing and payment. Additionally, an approved batch will generate a CSV file that will be downloaded to the agentâ€™s workstation. If a claim in a batch needs correction, Porter agents will have to manually modify the tickets to exclude them from the batch results.",
